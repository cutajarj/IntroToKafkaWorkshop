Assuming you have downloaded and can run the kafka utils locally here is a list of tasks to do:

1. Find out the retention period config of your topic (the one created in exercise 1) (HINT not kafkatopics)
2. Change retention period to 12 hrs (43200000ms) (HINT not kafkatopics)
3. Create new topic called "kafkaTrainingRep$username" with 5 partitions and 2 replicas
